The XRP Token \nThe plain words of Howey make clear that “an investment contract for purposes of the \nSecurities Act means a contract, transaction[,] or scheme.” 328 U.S. at 298–99 (emphasis \nadded). But the subject of a contract, transaction, or scheme is not necessarily a security on its \nface. Under Howey, the Court analyzes the economic reality and totality of circumstances \nsurrounding the offers and sales of the underlying asset. See Tcherepnin, 389 U.S. at 336; \nGlen-Arden, 493 F.2d at 1034. \nHowey and its progeny have held that a variety of tangible and intangible assets can serve \nas the subject of an investment contract. See, e.g., Howey, 328 U.S. 293 (orange groves); \nGlen-Arden, 493 F.2d 1027 (whiskey casks); Edwards, 540 U.S. 389 (payphones); Hocking v. \nDubois, 885 F.2d 1449 (9th Cir. 1989) (condominiums), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1078 (1990); \nCont’l Mktg.

In each of these cases, the subject of the \ninvestment contract was a standalone commodity, which was not itself inherently an investment \ncontract. For instance, if the original citrus groves in Howey were later resold, those resales may \nor may not constitute investment contracts, depending on the totality of circumstances \nsurrounding the later transaction. \nHere, Defendants argue that XRP does not have the “character in commerce” of a \nsecurity and is akin to other “ordinary assets” like gold, silver, and sugar.
